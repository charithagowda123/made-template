Title
New York â€“ Analyzing the Relationship Between Census Data and Electric Vehicle Registrations

Main Question
Is there a relationship between Census data and the number of electric vehicles registered across the counties of New York?

Description
The relationship between Census data and the number of electric vehicles (EVs) registered across New York's counties examines how factors such as income, education, and urbanization influence EV adoption. Higher-income and more educated areas are typically more likely to adopt EVs due to increased environmental awareness and access to incentives. Urban counties, with better infrastructure like charging stations, may also see more EV registrations. This analysis helps to understand regional patterns of EV adoption, revealing how socioeconomic and demographic factors drive the transition to cleaner energy in different parts of the state.
